# UFC website simplified 

## TODO
- Fix catchweights?
    - unsure how to go about this one
    - Do I even need to fix?
- Update the homepage to show upcoming event and maybe rankings 
    - Should fighter rankings should be on a separate page?
- Create pages for fighters individually 
    - Create the redirect url <-- Issues with this might have to switch over to vue js
    - Create the info page
    - Gather more data for each fighter
- Host it on local server
